            <h2>Find Study Spot</h2>
            <p>The Study Spaces tool at U-M helps you locate and reserve specific areas for studying, computer use, attending remote classes, or simply finding a quiet place to relax between classes. <br>
                It's understandable that some may feel concerned about the limited number of spaces available on the site, especially after last academic year when reserving study spaces was the main method of access. As we move into the new academic year, several areas have been designated as open, no longer requiring reservations. However, some spaces have been taken offline due to in-person classes resuming or an increased demand for event space.
